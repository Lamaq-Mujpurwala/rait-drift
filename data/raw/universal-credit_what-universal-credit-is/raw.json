These are called your ‘assessment periods’. You’ll  usually get your Universal Credit payment 7 days after each monthly assessment period ends.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances\">Changes in your circumstances</a> can affect how much you’re paid for your assessment period. You should report a change of circumstances to get the correct payment.</p>\n\n<p>Your first assessment period starts the day you make a claim.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n  <p>Example</p>\n\n  <p>Sam makes a new Universal Credit claim on 10 September.</p>\n\n  <p>Sam’s first assessment period runs for one month to 9 October, with a new assessment period beginning on 10 October.</p>\n\n  <p>They get paid on 17 October and then on the 17th of each month after that.​</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"payment-dates\">Payment dates</h2>\n\n<p>After the first payment, you’ll be paid on the same date of every month.</p>\n\n<p>If your payment date is on a weekend or a bank holiday, you’ll be paid on the working day before.</p>\n\n<p>You can see your monthly statement in your online account. This tells you how much Universal Credit you’re going to get.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-you-live-in-scotland\">If you live in Scotland</h3>\n\n<p>You can get paid once or twice a month.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re making a new claim, you’ll get a notification about how often you want to be paid. You get this after your first payment.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re already getting Universal Credit and have not had a notification, you can ask your work coach if you can be paid twice a month.</p>\n\n<p>When you’re paid twice a month your first payment will be for a full month. You’ll get the first half of your second month’s payment a month after this. The second half will be paid 15 days later. This means there will be about a month and a half between your first payment and the full amount for your second month.</p>\n\n<p>After this, you’ll be paid twice a month.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n  <p>Example</p>\n\n  <p>You get your first payment on 14 December.

This is called an <a href=\"/government/publications/universal-credit-alternative-payment-arrangements\">alternative payment arrangement (APA)</a>. Having an APA could mean:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your rent is paid directly to your landlord</li>\n  <li>you receive payments twice a month instead of once a month</li>\n  <li>you arrange to get a separate payment from your partner</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should contact Universal Credit after you’ve made a claim to ask for an APA. They’ll decide whether you should have an APA based on your circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>You’re more likely to get an APA if you have things like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>unpaid rent (also known as being in ‘rent arrears’)</li>\n  <li>addiction problems</li>\n  <li>mental health issues</li>\n  <li>learning difficulties</li>\n  <li>experience of homelessness</li>\n  <li>experience of domestic abuse</li>\n</ul>\n",
